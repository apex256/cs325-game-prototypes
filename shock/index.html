<h2>Shock</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The originality of my game is the aspect of building potentially your own homes and shelters with the in-game builder engine. And I guess the tilemap is original since I made it.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I programmed AI for the ghosts, I made a builder engine for building physics objects in real-time for the blocks, and I made a grid system for the game map to lock block placement.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
This assignment taught me more about how inheritance in JavaScript works. The easiest thing was setting up the inital skeleton of the game and the hardest thing was alligning the grid system perfectly.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Button Press Sound: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/Nightflame/sounds/397599/">Menu FX 02</a></li>
<li>Pistol Shoot Sound: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/LeMudCrab/sounds/163456/">Pistol Shot</a></li>
<li>Block sprite: Created by me</li>
<li>Tilemap: Created by me</li>
<li>Tileset: Created by me</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
All of the code was made by me. The cloesest game this prototype resembles is Minecraft and Terraria
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You must build fortifications and defences in the setup stage, then survive with those in the defence stage.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Sometimes simple is better.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used keyboard and mouse inputs, deterministic/random gameplay, the craftsman, and a side-scroller/puzzle genre.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic being prototyped was the block building engine and the grid system.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should feel calm and serene during the setup phase, then a rush of panic in the defence phase.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can move left, right, jump up, place blocks, and remove blocks. When a player places a block they should have 1 less block to place and it should not overlap with another block. When a player removes a block the player should regain an additional block to place.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
A good strategy is to go into the case and build fortifications there, the shape of the cave can mis-lead some ghosts if they spawn ontop of the cave.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You were run over and hit by a truck and now you are reincarnated into another world as a chicken! But all of the villians you have taken down in your previous life have made a dimensional wormhole and are trying to haunt you as ghosts! You must use your carpentry skills from your previous life to survive the wave of ghosts that seek revenge!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target-audience this is trying to reach is anyone.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It takes about 2 minutes in total to play 1 round and progress through the 2 stages.
</li>
