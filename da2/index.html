<h2>Another Life</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The originality of my game is the aspect of climbing/flying up in the sky whilst dodging fart clouds.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I used a object-oriented approach to phaser with the seperations of scenes and objects. I used a tilemap for this assignment instead of a generic background image. Then I used Photoshop to create the heaven "effect" for the top of the screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
This assignment taught me some more refinement on javascript. I learned more about how classes and how scripts are loaded and was able to remove a lot of redundant code. The easiest part was the the coding and the hardest part was making the sprites and assets.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>All of the default assets used: <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/phaser3-tutorial-src.zip">Phaser Tutorial Asset Pack (href is a link to a file not page)</a></li>
<li>Song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF32DRg9opA">DuckTales Music (NES) - The Moon Theme</a></li>
<li>Ghost sprite: Created by me</li>
<li>Fart sprite: Created by me</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
All of the code was made by me, I did use the framework and architecture from my first assignment. The closest other game to this would be Flappy Bird.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Your name is Jeff and you have just died, you must now race to heaven while dodging the farts from Satan in order to make it to the after-life!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the theme of life and death.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used keyboard inputs, randomness, the achiever play-type, and a side(top) scroller genre.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic being prototyped by this game is the flying or "hop flying" mechanic. This mechanic is similar to the flappy bird fly mechanic except it is used in a different directional plane.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should feel excitement as he rushes to the heavens and immediate fear as he sees Satan's farts.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can move up, left, and right. He has to dodge green fart clouds while heading up the map. The Left and Right arrows should move the player accordingly and the space key should propel the player up. The player should die (again since he is a ghost) when he touches a green fart cloud, and he should win when he reaches a certain point on top (heaven).
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
A good strategy for this is to not rush up the map and to take your time with your hops. You can often times rush up into a fart cloud and die.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are Jeff, you have died, and now you are trying to get to heaven from earth as a ghost without being hit by Satan's deadly toxic fart clouds.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target-audience this is trying to reach is for children to teenagers.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It takes about 2 minutes to rush up the map, with some delicacy it can take 2-4 minutes.
</li>
