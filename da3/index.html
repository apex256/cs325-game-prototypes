<h2>The Last Laundromat</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The originality of my game is the aspect of shooting cats from a cannon and moving throughout the city.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I used a object-oriented approach to phaser with the seperation of scenes and objects. I used a tilemap with varrying layers and tilesets for this assignment instead of a generic background image. I also made my own AI and implemented a healthbar class, this healthbar is interactive with a health system I made for each of the objects (player/ghost). I also had to go into a pre-built plugin and modify it to work with Phaser3 in scene decomposition (WeaponsPlugin.js).
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
This assignment taught me how to work with more advanced tilemaps with varrying layers and tilesets. The easiest part was getting the previous starter code I had up, running, and tweaked for this new project. The hardest part was debugging an outdated, not updated plugin called WeaponsPlugin.js.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>All of the default assets used: <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/phaser3-tutorial-src.zip">Phaser Tutorial Asset Pack (href is a link to a file not page)</a></li>
<li>Song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t59rPphm8w&t=9s">Esper Battle Final Fantasy XII Music Extended HD</a></li>
<li>Ghost sprite: Created by me</li>
<li>Player sprite: Created by me</li>
<li>Cat sprite: Created by me</li>
<li>Tilemap: Created by me</li>
<li>Tileset: <a href="www.kenny.nl">Kenny Vleugels</a>></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
All of the code was made by me except portions of the health-bar class, that was obtained from phasers' examples page. The closest other game to this would be Contra for the NES.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are a dude that just got done with his laundry! But the evil ghosts have invaded from the underworld! You must now fight with your cat shooting gun to save the town!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The dead should stay dead. (Spooky ghosts)
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used keyboard inputs, deterministic gameplay, the achiever, and a shooter game genre.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic being prototyped was the healthbar mechanic and the weapons plugin.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should feel determination in his goal to purge the world of ghosts.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can move left, right, jump up, shoot cats, and sprint. When a player shoots a ghost the ghost should take damage with the healthbar decreasing, when the player gets hit by a ghost he should take damage with the healthbar decreasing.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
A good strategy for this is to not rush up the map and to take your time with your hops. You can often times rush up into a fart cloud and die.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Your name is Dave and you were traumatized by a ghost when you were a little child, now that the ghosts are invading from the underworld you see this as your chance to get back at them while saving the world.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target-audience this is trying to reach is for teenagers and young-adults.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It takes about 2 minutes to clear all the ghosts, it can be longer if you spend more time dodging and conserving health.
</li>
