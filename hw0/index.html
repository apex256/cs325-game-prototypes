<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
This project taught me how to use Phaser3 and Javascript with a level of object-orientation.
The hardest part was switching from Phaser2 to Phaser3, I had previously made the game in Phaser2 but after seeings the amount of support Phaser3 had I decided to switch over. The easiest part was the conceptual idea of the game. I find it easier to prototype digitally than I do physically.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Bouncing Phaser image: <a href="https://phaser.io/download/logo">Phaser logo</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Field not used for this assignment.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
A strategy that I tested and found effective was to stay in a small area and make small and basic movements to avoid the blocks instead of running the length of the map.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target-audience this is trying to reach is for young children.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The play time is all dependent on the player's skill, in theory this could go on forever, but the average playtime is 1-5 minutes.
</li>
